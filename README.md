# Programizer
A simple task organizer program designed to perform basic task-inputting, editing, viewing, and deleting by utilizing file handling methods.

## Setup
- If the repository hasn't been updated and doesn't have folders, create a folder named `database` and a folder in it named `lists` since C++ can't make folders 
- If the repo has said folders, you can delete `database/sample-users.txt` and `database/lists/sample-list.txt`
- Run `programizer-stable.exe`
